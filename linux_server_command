1. Keep connection alive between server and local machine (Linux/Mac), two approach

a. on local

1) sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
2) add: 
Host *
ServerAliveInterval 120

This is how often, in seconds, it should send a keepalive message to the server. If that doesn't work then train a monkey to press enter every two minutes while you work.

b. on server

1) sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
2) add: 
Host *
ClientAliveInterval 120
